```

This is a personal package containing code for themes and colour settings that I happen to use regularly. Please feel free to download and use it. If you see any improvements or extensions you could make, please do make a pull request.

This package can be installed via devtools using

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("hwarden162/hbwthemes")
```

## Transparency

When using a plot in a powerpoint I sometimes like to make different parts of the plot and legend background transparent to help with consistent colouring (although this is often not a good idea). **This code has not been tested by me and there is a known bug concerning an interaction with `ggsave`**.
